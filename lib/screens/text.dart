Each widget has a lot of freedom when applying the general rule, so there is no way of knowing what it will do by just reading the widget’s name. If you try to guess, you’ll probably guess wrong. You can’t know exactly how a widget behaves unless you’ve read its documentation, or studied its source-code. The layout source-code is usually complex, so it’s probably better to just read the documentation. However, if you decide to study the layout source-code, you can easily find it by using the navigating capabilities of your IDE. Here is an example: Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of de Finibus Bonorum";
